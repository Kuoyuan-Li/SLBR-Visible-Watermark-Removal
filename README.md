### SLBR Network
Here is our proposed **SLBR**(**S**elf-calibrated **L**ocalization and **B**ackground **R**efinement). Top row depicts the whole framework of SLBR and bottom row elaborates the details of our proposed three modules.

## Quick Start
### Install
- Install PyTorch>=1.0 following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/)
- git clone https://github.com/bcmi/SLBR-Visible-Watermark-Removal.git
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data Preparation
In this paper, we conduct all of the experiments on the latest released dataset [CLWD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17y1gkUhIV6rZJg1gMG-gzVMnH27fm4Ij/view?usp=sharing)[[2]](#reference) and LVW[[3]](#reference). You can contact the authors of LVW to obtain the dataset.



### Train and Test
We provide a example of training and a test bash respectively:```scripts/train.sh```, ```scripts/test.sh``` 

Please specify the checkpoint save path in ```--checkpoint``` and dataset path in```--dataset_dir```.

## Visualization Results
We also show some qualitative comparision with state-of-art methods:
